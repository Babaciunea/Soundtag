SOUNDTAG TUTORIAL

#1 get an nfc tag, obviously.
#2 install nfc tools( is on both android and iOS)
#3 get a link to write on the soundtag(tricky part)

A)So there are multiple ways to do this but the easiest one is just find a site like: 

sndtag.ru/m
sndtag.ru/s
sndtag.ru/t

these are all the sites I know

b) Another way is to go to https://www.myinstants.com/ru/index/ru
and copy the link of a sound you like (ofcourse you need to write it on the nfc card after)

C) This is the hardest way but imo the funniest because you can put any sound you like.
So first go to https://inname3.github.io/index.html
after that choose an image and an audio file and you should get the .html file and download it.
Thai is the hardest step. Go to GitHub.com and create a repositorie at https://github.com
( If You can't manage to do that go to https://youtu.be/-RZ03WHqkaY that should explain it)
after you made the repositorie add the .html file to your repository.
Ok finally the last step. To make the .html file a working link just like
https://teapot174.github.io
click on the .html file ,settings ,pages and select main branch and hit save.if it doesn't work with main branch just select the other branch and it should work. Just don't forget to hit save. In the end you should see the GitHub link be created on the top of the screen. If you made it this far into the steps then I guess I don't need to explain how to write it on the nfc tag

D) The original one that I used but isn't worth using it is just putting the audio file in an Google drive account and copying the link, then of course writing it on the nfc tag.
